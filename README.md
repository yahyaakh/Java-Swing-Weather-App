# Java Swing Weather App

## Overview
The **Java Swing Weather App** is a dynamic desktop application built using Java Swing. It features an interactive GUI with custom images and intuitive controls, enabling users to retrieve and display real-time weather data for any specified city. The app integrates external APIs—including the Weather Forecast API and Geolocation API—to fetch accurate weather information, which is parsed using the Simple JSON library.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI:**  
  Utilizes Java Swing to build a user-friendly interface complete with custom images and intuitive controls.
- **Real-Time Weather Data:**  
  Retrieves weather information such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed via external API calls.
- **Dynamic Image Handling:**  
  Displays weather-specific images (e.g., clear, cloudy, rain, snow) based on API responses.
- **JSON Parsing:**  
  Employs the Simple JSON library for efficient parsing of API responses.
- **User Feedback:**  
  Updates the GUI dynamically as soon as new data is received from the APIs.

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or later.
- **Simple JSON Library:** Ensure the JSON library is added to your project's classpath.
- **Image Assets:** Confirm that image files (e.g., `clear.png`, `cloudy.png`) are in the specified directories.
